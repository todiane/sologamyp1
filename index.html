                <p>Sologamy (or self-marriage) is becoming popular as more people embrace learning how to be their own friend and love themselves first. </p>
                <p>It is the ultimate act of self-love that a person can engage in â€“ a commitment to truly loving yourself. You become your own partner. The Sologamy Club is here to support anyone looking to set up their own self-marriage. We provide mutual respect and support along with resources that will help you create a special day for yourself. 
                </p>
