# Sologamy Club

The Sologamy club is a site that aims to support anyone looking to **embrace the idea of marriage by a person to themself** by providing information and support on the topic. The website targets anyone looking to learn more about sologamy and also encourages those looking to run their own event to register and become a member where additonal support is available.

## Features

This website has been built using a reponsive design. It is a three-page website that includes a homepage, ceremonies page and a registration page. The website uses a charcoal font with the main body font being Monserrat and the H1 and H2 headers in Open Sans.

### **Navigation**

Featured at the top of each page, the navigation includes the name of the club on the left - SOLOGAMY CLUB - which also links to the top of the index page.

On the right-hand side of the website are the navigation links which are included on all three pages. Home - linking to the index page, Ceremonies - providing photos of members and Register - where potential members can join. The linked menu allows for easy access to each page without having to click on the back button. There is also an internal link on the index page to the ceremonies page and an internal link on the ceremonies page to the registration page allowing for an easy flow for users to go from one point to another without needing to scroll back to the top.

### **Website Pages**

Index / Home Page

The Home page includes a full-width image of a hand with a ring and a reminder to embrace self-love as the greatest love of all. The lyrics have been taken from a song by Whitney Houston.

Ceremonies

The ceremonies page provides potential users with evidence of club members and how they spent their day. Different images were used to include a variety of people from someone taking the journey alone to others celebrating with family and some with friends.

This section provides the social proof a user needs before joining if they are considering running their own event.

Titles have been added to each photo which provides uers with a brief explaination of what is happening in the photo they are looking at and is accessible when they move their mouse over a photo. This only works if you are using a mouse so will not show on tech that doesn't include one e.g. mobiles.

At the end of the page are links to our social media profiles.

In the future the aim is to include videos that members have shared on TickTok and/or YouTube to this page.

Registration Page

This page has been kept brief in order to encourage users to take one action without the need to read loads of content. There is a registration form which asks for minimal details and includes reference to whether they wish to take part in offline meetups and/or online meetups. It also includes a question relevant to our business about how they found us but this is not a required field.
